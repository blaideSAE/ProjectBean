  possibleAnswers:
  - What it has to provide, so many great things I can have, and people who can help
    me get there!
  - The peace and quiet, the less racket we have to deal with, the more comfortable
    we can live.
  - A healthy and developing culture and ecosystem, the more they grow, the more
    we do.
  - The freedom to express ourselves, it's important that a community stays creative!
